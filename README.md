Overview:
The GPA / CGPA Calculator is a desktop application developed in Java that enables students to compute their Grade Point Average (GPA) or Cumulative GPA (CGPA) efficiently. The project emphasizes modular programming, separating course data and calculation logic from the GUI, making it clean, maintainable, and scalable.

Key Features:

Add multiple courses with name, credits, and grade.

Automatically calculates the weighted GPA/CGPA.

Displays all courses in a scrollable, easy-to-read list.

Input validation ensures grades are between 0â€“10 and credits are positive.

Simple, intuitive, and professional Swing-based GUI.

Technologies Used:

Java 8+

Swing for GUI

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles

Benefits:

Allows students to calculate GPA/CGPA quickly and accurately.

Eliminates manual calculation errors.

Acts as a portfolio project demonstrating Java programming, GUI design, and OOP concepts.

Future Enhancements:

Export results to PDF or CSV.

Map numeric grades to letter grades.

Include semester-wise GPA calculations.
